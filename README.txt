Render Email Buzz v01 by Shico

2) Google "Gmail security" and click on "review settings" then activate "2 Step verification".

3) back in "Gmail security" search results, click on "app password".

4) Generate and new app password and note it down to be used later.


In blender:

5) Go to Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons -> Install , navigate to where the add-on file was downloaded and select it.

6) check the box to activate the add-on. and the go find it in the "Properties" panel under "Scene" tab.

7) Scroll down to "Enable Email Notification" and enable it if it is not checked yet.

8) Enter the "Sender" and "Receiver" emails, along with the app password you generated before.

= Every time a render is complete, you will receive an email.


* Un-check the box to disable the add-on when you want to do quick render tests.

** If you save the file, the details will be saved with the current project. However, if you open a new project you will have to fill the details again.
